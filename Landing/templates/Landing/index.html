                <p>The purpose of this project is to enhance the medical services that can be availed to patients by 
                    decreasing response time spent in diagnosis and allocation of resources for their treatment. 
                    Currently, people experiencing health problems need to check in to some health care center, get 
                    diagnosed and need to find the right place for treatment by themselves, if suitable resources 
                    arenâ€™t available right off the bat. 
                </p>
                 <p>   The proposed system aids the diagnosis by the means of an AI powered first responder chatbot, 
                    predicting potential ailments based on its symptoms, contacting relevant doctors and making 
                    necessary arrangements by directing patients to proper health care facilities, thereby saving 
                    valuable time and efficiently prioritizing medical response to patients, alongside providing 
                    real-time, face recognition-based patient security to concerned hospital management.</p>
